## SLIDE 1: RESEARCH QUESTION & REASONING

### Title: Research Question and Reasoning

**Main Research Question:**
What spatial and socioeconomic factors explain income inequality across villages in Hsinchu City?

**Why This Matters:**

🗺️ **Geographic Context:**
- Hsinchu = Taiwan's "Silicon Valley" (Science Park, 160,000+ tech workers)
- Extreme inequality: 8.7x income difference between richest and poorest villages

📊 **Policy Relevance:**
- Identify drivers of inequality → Target interventions
- Guide urban planning and infrastructure investment

🔬 **Scientific Contribution:**
- First village-level spatial analysis of Hsinchu income (122 villages)
- Tests multiple economic theories simultaneously

**Approach:** Income = f(Human Capital + Economic Geography + Demographics)

## SLIDE 2: THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

### Title: Theoretical Background

**Four Economic Theories:**

| Theory | Mechanism | Key Citation | Hsinchu Application |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Human Capital** ✅ | Education → Skills → Income | Becker (1964) | Higher education areas = Higher income |
| **Agglomeration** | Clustering → Knowledge spillovers → Wage premium | Krugman (1991) | Proximity to Science Park = Higher income |
| **Demographics** | Aging → Lower labor force → Reduced income | Lee & Mason (2010) | High aging areas = Lower income |
| **Environmental Disamenity** | Noise → Residential sorting → Income stratification | Nelson (2004) | Airbase proximity = Lower income |

**Empirical Support:**
- Human Capital: 60+ years evidence, 10% wage return per education year
- Agglomeration: 30-40% tech cluster wage premium
- Aging: 10% increase in 60+ → 5.5% GDP decrease
- Disamenity: 5-15% property value reduction near airports

## SLIDE 3: HYPOTHESES

### Title: Hypotheses

**Regression Model:**
```
Income = β₀ + β₁(Education) + β₂(Dist_SciPark) + β₃(Aging) + β₄(Dist_Airbase) + Controls + ε
```

**Primary Hypotheses:**

| H# | Variable | Expected Sign | Magnitude | Theory |
|----|----------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| **H1** | **Tertiary Education Rate (%)** | **✅ Positive (+)** | **STRONG** | Human Capital |
| **H2** | Distance to Science Park (km) | ❌ Negative (−) | Moderate | Agglomeration |
| **H3** | Aging Index | ❌ Negative (−) | Moderate | Demographics |
| **H4** | Distance to Airbase (km) | ✅ Positive (+) | Small | Environmental |

**Controls:** Indigenous ratio (−), Population density (+)

**Key Points:**
- H1 (Education) strongest predictor in literature - expect largest effect
- All hypotheses grounded in peer-reviewed economics research
- Cross-sectional data → Test spatial associations consistent with theory

**Limitation:** Cannot prove causation, only spatial patterns consistent with causal theories
